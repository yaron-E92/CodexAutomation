Stack context:
{{StackContext}}

Automation context:

- The configured local verification command is: {{LocalCheck}}
- Build/run/tests are handled by the automation script after your changes.
- Do NOT run build, tests, formatters, app startup, package installs, migrations, or broad commands unless explicitly instructed.
- You are expected to edit files directly in the workspace.

Goal:
Implement the issue below using the Planner output as constraints.

Hard constraints:

- Speed > elegance.
- No premature abstractions.
- Do NOT over-decompose.
- Touch as few files as possible.
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones.
- Implement the minimal viable complete solution.
- Do not change domain logic, persistence, models, migrations, public APIs, schemas, scoring, task state logic, or unrelated behavior unless explicitly required.
- If unsure, make a reasonable assumption and proceed.
- Do not leave TODO-only implementations or empty stubs.
- Do not perform opportunistic cleanup.
- Do not reformat unrelated files.

Implementation rule:

- Implement Option A from the Planner unless blocked.
- Use Option B only if Option A is clearly unsafe, impossible, or much messier.
- Edit the repository files directly.
- Do not only describe a patch. Apply the change.

Output format after editing:

1) Files changed
2) Brief summary of actual changes, file-by-file
3) Brief assumptions only if necessary

Do NOT include:

- Long explanations
- Refactoring ideas
- Future work
- Test plans unless directly required by the issue
- Patch diffs unless useful for explaining a tiny change after it has already been applied

Planner output:
{{Plan}}

Issue:
{{IssueText}}

Now implement by editing the workspace.
